# To perform mathematical operations between objectives of different magnitudes, a normalization step is needed first. This is quite simple: for each 	#
# GA objective we take the highest value that has ever appeared in the base and classify it as 1. We take the smallest value and classify it as 0. All 	#
# other values we assign a value between 0 and 1 according to the value of it, the maximum and the minimum. After doing this for all objectives, the 	#
# values will all have the same magnitude.																												#
# Formula:																																				#
# 	Normalized value = difference to the minimum / difference between extremes																			#
# Example:																																				#
# 	Maximum value: 10																																	#
# 	Minimum value: 5																																	#
# 	Value of a current goal: 6																															#
# The calculation looks like this:																														#
# 	Difference to minimum = 6 - 5 = 1																													#
# 	Difference between extremes = 10 - 5 = 5																											#
# 	Normalized value = 1 / 5 = 0.2																														#
# Fill in the values as described in the README.conf file.																								#
